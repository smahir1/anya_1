        <p>My friends Avi and Dhyan came to my house to play. We decided to play 21 Dares. I got the dare and Dhyan gave it to me. He told me to give my laptop for 5 mins. I gave it and went down because my mom called me. Till then he went through my hangouts and took your email. When I came back I tried to take my laptop back but then he already got your email. When he went home, he emailed you all that stuff.

            Look, I swear I am telling the truth.
            I don't want to break our friendship</p>
